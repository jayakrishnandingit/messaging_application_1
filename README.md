# Objective

A service that when run will publish a message to the RabbitMQ exchange and shuts down by itself. This is a project that I built to learn pika and RabbitMQ by my own. I have been using these technologies in my projects but those are legacy codebase and I am only using them but not setup. So I wanted to learn one step deep.

# Dependencies
- Docker.

# Packages/Libraries
* Python3.
* pika.
* faker.
* factory_boy.
* RabbitMQ docker image.

# Environment variables
* AMQP_URL.
